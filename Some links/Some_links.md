# Useful links

Here are a bunch of online ressources that I found useful when learning/teaching bioinformatics.



- Data Carpentry [workshop on genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/). Comprises a nice intro to how to interact with the linux shell.

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickam and Garett Grolemund. Introduction to data analysis using the tidyverse.
* [A Data-Centric Introduction to Computing](https://dcic-world.org/2021-08-21/index.html) by Kathi Fisler, Shriram Krishnamurthi, Benjamin S. Lerner, & Joe Gibbs Politz . Cool introduction to computer science using pyret (and a bit of python) 

* Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw), in particular the series about Calculus and Linear Algebra. Explanatory math videos
