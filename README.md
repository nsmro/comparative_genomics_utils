# Comparative genomics utilities

This is a repository which comprises a bunch of information and scripts that I think can be useful for comparative genomics analyses:

Some of these scripts are part of different publications and are either in bitbucket repos or in the supplemet of papers, I just wanted to centralize some of the most reusable resources by theme (e.g. microsynteny, orthology) 



# Categories

* Microsynteny: conserved blocks. Description of the *chrom format can be found there.

* Orthology: mostly deals with orthofinder >= 2.4 output to convert it into internal format

* Developmental RNAseq: 

* Links: online tutorials/books that came in handy
