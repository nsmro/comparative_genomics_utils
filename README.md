# Comparative genomics utilities

This is a repository which comprises a bunch of information and scripts that I think can be useful for comparative genomics analyses:

Some of these scripts are part of different publications and are either in bitbucket repos or in the supplement of papers, I just wanted to centralize some of the most reusable resources by theme (e.g. microsynteny, orthology) 

# Categories

* Macrosynteny: make an oxford dotplot with R.

* Microsynteny: conserved blocks. Description of formats specific to the MicroSynteny tool ([Simakov et *al.* 2013](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature11696)) can be found there.

* Orthology: deals with orthofinder >= 2.4 output to convert it into clus format. 

* Other utils: small scripts for small tasks.

* Some Links: online tutorials/books that I found useful for teaching basics
